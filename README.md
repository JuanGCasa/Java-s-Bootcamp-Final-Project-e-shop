## Welcome to my Final Project for the Java Bootcamp!

### An E-Shop app with example products, shopping cart, checkout and more!

So my project consists in two parts you need to install to test it!

-The first one is this repo, where you'll find some **sql queries** to startup a local database and create its user.
Also it has the **project's backend** written in **Java**, just by running the app and with your SQL working it should work amazing in your localhost8080

-The second one is the repo with the **frontend**. For practical reasons this repo was created separated from the backend one. You can find it in my github:
https://github.com/JuanGCasa/Java-s-Bootcamp-Final-Project-Frontend.git
Frontend was created in **Angular** so you'll need to install its dependencies to build this. (more instructions in the link above)
